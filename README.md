## Tran Thanh Luan - toilaluan

I'm Luan, a Senior AI Engineer and Tech Entrepreneur with expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Generative Models, Computer Science, and System Design.

I'm the founder of **condenses.ai**, a startup providing prompt compression services built on a Decentralized Network (Subnet 47 - Bittensor). I developed the validation framework that incentivizes miners to contribute their best compression algorithms, creating an AI competition where performance determines rewards. At its peak, this subnet captured nearly 1% of network emissions. While **condenses.ai** is technically functional, we're still working toward market adoption and revenue generation.

I graduated from Hanoi University of Science and Technology with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. My professional experience includes:
- **Head of Decentralized AI at ZenAI**, I lead the team to build subnets on Bittensor with various incentive mechanisms: decentralized image & llm inference (subnet 23), decentralized contest host (subnet 61), decentralized api bridge (subnet 18)...
- **Senior AI Engineer at ZenAI**, where I worked on Generative Models for image, video, and text personalization, fine-tuning diffusion models, and customizing ComfyUI pipelines.
- **Data Scientist at Pixta Vietnam**, where I built an Auto Review System for Pixta Stock and distilled LLMs for specific domains

Beyond my professional projects, I'm committed to advancing my AI expertise through independent research and experimentation. I regularly work on training models from scratch (LLM, Diffusion, Flow Matching related models), learning to optimize CUDA processing, Triton-lang, and implementing state-of-the-art papers. My versatility allows me to excel in both cutting-edge research and practical engineering applications across machine learning, deep learning, and broader computer science fields.
